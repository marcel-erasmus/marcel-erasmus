### Guten Tag! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer living in South Africa. 

I like solving problems and learning new things.

My main area of expertise is in software development using Java and Spring, but I believe in choosing the right tool for the job.

Over the course of my career I have garnered quite a bit of experience with full stack development in working with frontends, microservices and breaking up monoliths. I have worked with many different programming languages, frameworks (proprietary and open-source) and tools over the years.
