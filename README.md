## Guten Tag! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer living in Cape Town, South Africa.

I've worked on projects that span across various industries, including Education, Banking, Insurance, Credit, and Forex. Due to the nature of working in technology, my toolset and skills are constantly evolving. Having said that, at present I frequently utilise the following:
- Bash
- Git
- Linux
- Java
- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- React
- Spring
- TypeScript
